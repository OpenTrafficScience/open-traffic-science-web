Traffic science can be traced back to 1956. Leslie C. Edie, Robert Herman, Robert E. Chandler, Denos Gazis, Elliott W. Montroll, Refrey B. Potts, and Richard W. Rothery opened up this direction that time. They did huge amount of field experiments, opening up the ISTTT symposium series, and write few fantastic textbooks. In the era of connected and automated vehicles and artificial intelligence, we plan to revisit traffic science with emerging technologies and open data.

We need to identify the **fundamental questions** in our research community. No matter how the technologies evolve, the fundamental questions remain consistent. The philosophy behind this initiative is to mentor the younger generation using first principle.

> The first principle is a foundational concept or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition and serves as the basic building block for understanding and reasoning.

Open data, open code, open knowledge, and open mind.
