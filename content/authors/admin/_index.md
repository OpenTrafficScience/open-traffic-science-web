Traffic science in the era of connected and automated vehicles.

We plan to include both traditional traffic flow theory and new emerging methods.

We might need to create a "knowledge tree", offering different learning paths, such that people can customize their learning process. 

As a textbook, although we might be able to include more engineering details, I think we should pay more attention to really the scientific part. Or, we should saparete those tedious (although important) data processing with true science and knowledge. This is why I recognize myself as an engineering scientistc.
