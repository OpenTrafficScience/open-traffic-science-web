**Junyi Ji** is a PhD student at Vanderbilt University in CEE and VU-ISIS. He is mainly devoted to the I-24 MOTION testbed. His research focuses on understanding *the nature of traffic waves* and developing a mathematical digital twin for the freeway testbed. His research vision is to integrate computational methods and cyber-physical systems (CPS) for sustainable transportation solutions aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He is a strong advocate for open science. He is the convener of the workshop on vehicle trajectory data camp and actively volunteers with organizations such as Citipedia, RERITE, and MoveVU.

**Xingmin** Wang is currently working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, supersized by Dr. Henry Liu (Download my CV here). He received his Ph.D. degree in Civil Engineering and Scientific Computing at University of Michigan in 2023 and his Bachelorâ€™s degree in School of Vehicle and Mobility at Tsinghua University. His research interests include traffic flow model, traffic control & operations, particularly with big data and connected & automated transportation. His research works are founded on a variety of methodologies including applied statistics, network science, machine learning, and optimization. His work on *optimizing traffic signals* with connected vehicle data has been covered by media including UofM news, AP news, and Wall Street Journal. He has received the 2024 INFORMS TSL Best Dissertation Award and been selected as a finalist for the IEEE ITSS Best Dissertation Award.
